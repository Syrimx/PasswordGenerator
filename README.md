# PasswordGenerator
Password Generator Gui in Python
Just a little Toy, nothing special

#tkinter as dependency
#pwgen2.py as dependency
#-> pwgen2 could also be used as standalone console app

- pwgen2 saves the passwords into the keys+.txt file.
  If you don't want this to happen, just modify pwgen2 by erasing Line 11 & 12.
- You can change the length of the fabricating password by changing the attribute of 
  the magic funktion in PasswortGenerator.py.

Feel free to use and or rewrite
